# Install

Install Node.js and run `npm install` in the directory.

# Running

To run it, just use `npm start`, it'll open a browser page with the shape rendered. The shape is in `src/main.ts`. Editing the file while the server is running will automatically refresh the page.

# Capture Image

To capture an image, just right click the rendered image and use "Save Image As".

The shape is fully rotatable using the mouse, or using the arrow keys to rotate around any of the three axes (up/down/left/right arrow keys for x/y axes, dot/comma for z axis).
